        <h2 id="overview">8.1 Overview of Social Engineering</h2>
        <p>
            Social engineering exploits human psychology to gain unauthorized access to information, systems, or physical locations. Instead of breaking through security defenses, attackers trick individuals into disclosing confidential information or performing
            actions that compromise security. The effectiveness of social engineering lies in the ability to manipulate trust and leverage social interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Social engineering is often referred to as "hacking humans" because it targets the human element of security. It can involve various tactics, including deception, manipulation, and impersonation. The primary goals of social engineering are:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Information Gathering</strong>: Collecting sensitive information such as passwords, personal details, or corporate secrets.</p>
        <p><strong>System Access</strong>: Gaining access to computer systems, networks, or physical facilities.</p>
        <p><strong>Manipulation</strong>: Convincing individuals to perform actions that compromise security, such as clicking on malicious links or installing malware.</p>
        <p>
            Social engineering attacks can be highly effective because they exploit natural human behaviors and emotions, such as trust, curiosity, fear, and urgency.
        </p>

        <h3 id="common-techniques">8.2 Common Techniques</h3>

        <h4>Phishing</h4>
        <p>Phishing is a technique where attackers send fraudulent emails, messages, or websites that appear to be from legitimate sources. The goal is to trick recipients into providing sensitive information or performing actions that benefit the attacker.</p>
        <p><strong>Types of Phishing:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Spear Phishing</strong>: Targeted phishing attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations.</p>
        <p><strong>Whaling</strong>: Phishing attacks targeting high-profile individuals, such as executives or government officials.</p>
        <p><strong>Clone Phishing</strong>: Creating a replica of a legitimate message with malicious links or attachments.</p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>Subject: Action Required: Update Your Account Information

Dear Customer,

We have detected unusual activity on your account. Please click the link below to verify your account information and ensure your security.

[Verify Account](http://malicious-link.com)

Thank you,

</code></pre>

        <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Educate employees about the signs of phishing.</li>
            <li>Implement email filters and anti-phishing technologies.</li>
            <li>Encourage the verification of links and sender information before taking action.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pretexting</h4>
        <p>Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario (pretext) to trick individuals into disclosing information or performing actions. The attacker often poses as someone in a position of authority or trust.</p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>Attacker: "Hi, this is John from IT. We're experiencing issues with your account. Can you please provide your username and password so we can resolve it?"
